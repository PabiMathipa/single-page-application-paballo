            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a front-end web developer with 9 years of working experience in
                fields like sales, customer support, social media, and management. I
                combine my management expertise with technical skills and fully commit
                to consistency, meeting deadlines, and utilizing all available resources
                to achieve results. I enjoy creating beautiful, accessible, and
                responsive websites using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Sass, SCSS, Vanilla
                JavaScript, and React. Effective use of time, problem-solving, and
                communication skills help me show a positive attitude in complex
                situations, and my desire to learn quickly adapts me to changing
                situations.
